#Write a Personal Greeter Program
#The Personal Greeter program adds a single, but very cool,
#element to the Greeter program: user input. Instead of working
#with a predefined value, the computer lets the user enter his or
#her name and then uses it to say hi.

#to input the user's name
usr_name=input("\n Please Enter your NAME \n")
#to print greeting and message
print("\n HI ",usr_name,"! HOW are you ? \n")
